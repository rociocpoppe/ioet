RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00- 21:00
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00
ANDRES=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00


OUTPUT
ASTRID-RENE: 2
ASTRID-ANDRES: 3
RENE-ANDRES: 2

Example 2:

INPUT:
RENE=MO10:15-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH13:00-13:15,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

OUTPUT:
RENE-ASTRID: 3


Solution
First of all, a reader was needed to process the data from the .txt file. This class provides the employees to the company, in which the employees are stored in a list. To compare their schedules, 
a directed graph was implemented. Each employee was thought as a vertex, and the times the coincided were thought as arcs with values, which provide the data needed for the output.
